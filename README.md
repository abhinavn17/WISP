# WISP

Wsclean Imaging and Selfcal Pipeline is a selfcal and imaging pipeline developed for radio interferometric imaging. The selfcal loop utilises modular CASA and is taken from CAPTURE-CASA6, written by Ruta Kale. This pipeline utilizes WSClean for ridiculous speedup of imaging. It requires cleaned and calibrated msfiles as input.

To run this pipeline, you need to build and install wsclean. The wsclean terminal command is passed as a subprocess call, and the specific imaging parameters can be passed as a "wsclean-command" in the config.ini file.

## How to use

1. To install, make a python environment and do:

```bash
pip install .
```

2. To run you need to make a config.ini file. It can be made using:

```bash 
wisp_config -c <config.ini name> <msfile>
```

3. Edit the parameters in the config file to your use case.

4. To run the selfcal loop, do:

```bash
wisp <config.ini>
```
